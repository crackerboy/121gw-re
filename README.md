Reverse engineering the EEVBlog 121GW

* The `pdfs` directory contains official documentation on the multimeter hardware (manuals, datasheets, etc.).
* The `binaries` directory contains the firmware and bootloader release binaries.
* The `database` directory contains the IDA database for the firmware. Please read the [DATABASE readme](database/DATABASE.md) before doing anything with it.

If you're just here to learn about the meter, start with the wiki up top.
